# pangu.py

将饱负盛名的 [`pangu.vim`][1] Vim 插件移植到 Python3 以便用在其它地方。

---

Port the wellknown [`pangu.vim`][1] Vim plugin to Python3 so that it can be used everywhere!
Usage: `pangu.py FILE` or `cat <SOMETHING> | pangu.py -`.
Options are the same as `pangu.vim`'s `g:pangu_rule_*` variables.

I'll try to sync the functionality with `pangu.vim`.
However, there's currently no support of range operation in `pangu.py`.
